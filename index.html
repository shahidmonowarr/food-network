        <h2>My Recipies</h2>
        <p>Biryani is a celebration of all that is great about Indian food – the heady aromas, the vibrant colours, the
            fluffy rice and those addictive curry flavours. Make this Chicken Biryani with your protein of choice – or
            try a
            vegetable biryani!</p>

            <h3>Jimmy Dean</h3>
            <p>No matter how crazy her house gets, Naomi’s Creamy Sausage and Mushroom Pasta Bake is always a calming
                force
                that brings everyone to the table.</p>

            <h3>Beef BBQ</h3>
            <p>beef is a fantastic choice for a summer barbecue. The rich, meaty flavour of beef combined with a nice
                smoky
                char from the grill is a thing to behold, and pairs beautifully with a huge range or marinades, rubs and
                sides.</p>

            <h3>Bean Soup</h3>
            <p>This White Bean Chicken Soup is a slurpable, soothing, chicken broth-based soup, that's filled with white
                beans, roasted chicken, savory herbs, and hearty root vegetables. It's craveable on cold and rainy days.
